## Purpose

This is an example that pretends to solve 4 simple study cases. The purpose of this project is to show code quality and good practices.

## Instructions
- run `bundle install`
- run the rake task to test the example_file_1.doc `rake ocr:turn_into_numbers`

## Tests
If you want to run all the tests just run `rspec .`

## Study Cases

### User Story 1 
The company has just recently purchased an ingenious machine to assist in reading policy report documents. The machine scans the paper documents for policy numbers, and produces a le with a number of entries which each look like this: 

![First image](/screenshots/first_image.png?raw=true)

Each entry is 4 lines long, and each line has 27 characters. The rst 3 lines of each entry contain an policy number written using pipes and underscores, and the fourth line is blank. Each policy number should have 9 digits, all of which should be in the range 0-9. A normal le contains around 500 entries. 
Your rst task is to write a program that can take this le and parse it into actual numbers. 


### User Story 2 
Having done that, you quickly realize that the ingenious machine is not in fact infallible. Sometimes it goes wrong in its scanning. So the next step is to validate that the numbers you read are in fact valid policy numbers. A valid policy number has a valid checksum. This can be calculated as follows: 
policy number: 3 4 5 8 8 2 8 6 5 
position names: d9 d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d3 d2 d1 
checksum calculation: 
(d1+2*d2+3*d3+...+9*d9) mod 11 = 0 
Your second task is to write some code that calculates the checksum for a given number, and identies if it is a valid policy number. 


### User Story 3 
Your boss is keen to see your results. He asks you to write out a le of your ndings, one for each input le, in this format: 
457508000 
664371495 ERR 
86110??36 ILL 
ie the le has one policy number per row. If some characters are illegible, they are replaced by a ?. In the case of a wrong checksum (ERR), or illegible number (ILL), this is
noted in a second column indicating status. 
Third task: write code that creates this le in the desired output. 


### User Story 4 
It turns out that often when a number comes back as ERR or ILL it is because the scanner has failed to pick up on one pipe or underscore for one of the gures. For example 

![Second image](/screenshots/second_image.png?raw=true)

The 9 could be an 8 if the scanner had missed one |. Or the 0 could be an 8. Or the 1 could be a 7. The 5 could be a 9 or 6. So your next task is to look at numbers that have come back as ERR or ILL, and try to guess what they should be, by adding or removing just one pipe or underscore. If there is only one possible number with a valid checksum, then use that. If there are several options, the status should be AMB. If you still canâ€™t work out what it should be, the status should be reported ILL. 
Your nal task is to write code that does the guess work described above to remove as many ERR and ILL as can safely be done.
